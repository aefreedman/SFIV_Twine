<div tiddler="Journal (a)" tags="" modified="201310172203" created="201310172203" modifier="twee">Frustrated. Am I getting any better? I have a hard time telling. I almost feel like I was doing better, or at least just as well when I didn't feel like I actually knew what I was doing.\n\nPlayed a dozen or so matches against a few people online today. I pretty much got bodies the whole time. Won maybe two or three rounds the whole night. I don't know if it was just because I was tired or I was just playing people who were just flat-out really good, but I was really down afterward. I didn't feel like I was doing anything obviously //bad//, its just that nothing was working.\n\nAt this point I've spent at least a couple hundred hours playing the game. I know that's not a lot compared to the people who have played since forever (usually SFII), but still, that's not an insignificant amount of time. I guess I can beat people who really //don't// know what they're doing and I can't get flat-out trolled anymore, but I'm having a hard time getting a lot out of playing against most other people. There doesn't seem to be a lot of people around my level: people who are trying to take the game seriously, but have just started. Either people are just fooling around or they're veterans.\n\nI've spent a lot of time researching and reading everything I can find, and I don't know how much that's actually helping me. I feel that there's a limit to the amount of training I can do just on my own. Like with practicing bread n' butter combos. I know what they are, and I'm getting the timing down, but doing them in training and doing them in a match is completely different.</div><div tiddler="Hitbox" tags="" modified="201310172249" created="201310172249" modifier="twee">Hitboxes are rectangular areas that the game engine uses to perform collision detection between the two characters.\n\nHitboxes are said to be &quot;active&quot; when a collision with that hitbox will result in taking damage. Correspondingly, the frames of an attack animation during which an attack can damage the other character are called //active frames//.\n\nIf two active hitboxes collide, both characters take damage. This is called a //trade//</div><div tiddler="Command Throw" tags="" modified="201310160105" created="201310160105" modifier="twee">A command throw is any throw special attack that is activated with a specific command other than the game's default throw command (short + jab in SF4).</div><div tiddler="Kinds of attacks" tags="" modified="201310160047" created="201310160047" modifier="twee">[[Aerials]]\n\nAnti-air\n</div><div tiddler="Fighting Game Basics" tags="basics" modified="201310160002" created="201310160002" modifier="twee">Okay so you really don't know anything about fighting games, huh?

This includes the most basic elements common to most fighting games, such as the health bars and damage. This also includes more specific elements such as //Counter Hits// and //Technicals//. Think of Game\s Mechanics as parts of the game that Street Fighter IV tries to tell you about or provides clear feedback on.\n\nTechniques, on the other hand, are derivations or implications of the game's Mechanics. For example, //Animation Frames// are a Mechanic, since you can see your character go through their animation frames and see whether you are in //Hit Stun// or //Block Stun//. //Frame Advantage//, however, is a Technique that derives from the interaction between two characters as they go through their //Animation Frames//. Consequently, because //Frame Advantage// (or //disadvantage//) is a technique, you can actively apply your knowledge of it during your play in order to gain an upper hand on your opponent!\n\nMechanics and Techniques combine to form [[Tactics|Tactics (Definition)]].</div><div tiddler="Health Bars" tags="" modified="201310160006" created="201310160006" modifier="twee">I'm going to assume that you know what health means in a game.

An armor break is indicated by a glass-shatter particle effect and sound effect. cf. Reversal Armor Break\n\nArmor Break is a property that counter's any //Armored// move and prevents the player using the armored move from absorbing an attack as //white damage//.\n\nSome Special Attacks are armored by default.

Dashing moves the character quicker than they would otherwise be able to move, and also alters their hitbox. For example, Juri can forward dash under some fireballs. While forward dashing, characters are considered grounded. While backdashing, characters are considered airborne.</div><div tiddler="Bread & Butter Combo" tags="" modified="201310160116" created="201310160116" modifier="twee">A bread & butter combo is a reliable combination of moves that you can use against most opponents.</div><div tiddler="More Theory" tags="" modified="201310161206" created="201310161206" modifier="twee">All games require an in-depth understanding of Mechanics in order to play them at a high level. This may seem obvious, but it is worth stating, nevertheless. Because game mechanics are integral to the game as a system of rules, a player who is good at a particular game necessarily understands the game's mechanics.\n\nHowever, one way in which games are different from one another arises out of how each one emphasizes or deemphasizes Technique, Tactics, and Strategy.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, fighting games tend to emphasize the technical end of the spectrum. This results from the combination of quick real-time gameplay and a complex input system. Compare fighting games with traditional board games like Chess and Go, for example. It is difficult to say that these games are highly techincal. Indeed, compared to fighting games, Chess and Go have simple, elegant rules, and playing the game doesn't require detailed knowledge about how to hold the pieces or how to place them on the board (etiquette aside). Moreover, it is absurd to argue that a particular technique for holding your pawn, or a method of placing your stones next to your opponent's makes you any more likely to win. Go and Chess instead rely heavily on strategy and tactics, and you may observe the consequences of this emphasis in the volumes of writings by professional players on these very topics.\n\nIf you spend any amount of time learning how to play a fighting game, however, you'll quickly realize how difficult it is to perform the moves you want, when you want to perform them. And I don't mean a situation such as one in which you could say, &quot;Oh, I really wanted to use this particular combo, but my opponent defended too well and I wasn't able to do it safely,&quot; I mean one more like &quot;Did you see how he just kara DP'd into his Ultra? I didn't even know you could do that! There's no way I could pull that off!&quot; Again, one obvious reason for this is the split-second timing that Street Fighter requires, and in this respect the game is more sport-like, or, to avoid any complex implications derived from using &quot;sport&quot; as a description, atheletic, at the very least.\n\nExclamations like the former one about the cancel into Ultra occur frequently when watching, discussing, and playing fighting games. Much of the training that you will do as you practice could be considered simple busywork. You practice your QCBs and DPs so that these multi-step inputs become automatic. You work to trivialize the nontrivial so that you can focus on other parts of your game. You never escape the consequences of fighting games' nontrivial input system, however. Your strategy could be perfect, but dropping the right combo at the wrong time can cost you a game.\n\nI do not mean that tactical or strategic knowledge and play is unimportant to fighting games. It's just that fighting games are much less abstract than Chess and Go, or other heavily strategic games. This has benefits, as well. Priveleging technique allows for surprising situations and a greater degree of uncertainty while playing. Theoretically, a certain move might cancel into an Ultra, yet the timing window might only be one frame, and the setup might also be impractical to the extent that any serious professional would never try to pull it off in a grand final match with everything on the line.\n\nBut, maybe one time they do. And maybe that one time they pull it off.\n\nThat's hype.</div><div tiddler="Hit Confirm" tags="" modified="201310172239" created="201310172239" modifier="twee">Hit Confirming is a technique that players use to extend the number of frames they have to respond to a succesful attack and continue with a combo.\n\nHit confirming is usually performed by using one or more relatively //safe// attacks (most character's light attacks can be used this way) that are hard to punish if blocked but provide an ability to continue into a more damaging combo if the attack connects.\n\nHit confirming is linked strongly to //footsies//. //Safe jumps// can also be thought of as a method or style or hit confirmation. </div><div tiddler="The First Question" tags="" modified="201310151249" created="201310151249" modifier="twee">Are you familiar with fighting games?\n\nPerhaps Mortal Kombat or Tekken.

At the most basic level, there are Game\s Mechanics, or simply Mechanics. After Mechanics, there are Techniques. Then Tactics and Strategies. At the highest level are pure ''Concepts''.\n\n&lt;-- practical ---------------------------------- abstract --&gt;\nMechanics -- Techniques -- Tactics -- Strategies -- Concepts\n\nTo provide some quick examples, Mechanics are things like &quot;moving&quot; and &quot;attacking&quot;--the raw bones of the game. A ''Concept'' is something like //Respect// that arises from playing the game, but has a stronger connection and more implications outside of the game.\n\nIf you're interested, I argue that spectators (especially those most unfamiliar with Street Fighter) have the easiest time understanding the game at the more abstract levels. Players, meanwhile, need a more holistic understanding that incorporates the practical end of the spectrum. Furthermore, fighting games place particular importance on the technical parts of the game.\n\nEven though I've placed these terms on a linear hierarchy, I don't want to give the impression that there is a necessarily linear relationship between the parts. It's a bit more complicated than that, unfortunately. As I stated previously, playing Street Fighter requires a holistic understanding of the bits that compose the Mechanical/Conceptual spectrum. However, you can't very well understand everything before you begin playing the game. If you could do that, Street Fighter wouldn't be something we could get better at in the first place! Instead, as you learn to play the game, you'll constantly traverse the spectrum and learn parts of it piecewise. Many times, you'll find that you won't understand the implications of a Mechanic until you incorporate a particular Strategy into your game. For example, perhaps your strategy is to pressure your opponent in the corner (//Corner Pressure//), and the best way to do so is to retain //Frame Advantage//, a Technique, by using //EX Focus Attack Dash Canceling//. If we examine this specific case in isolation, //EX FADC// would be quite meaningless without the context of your higher-level strategic goal to provide it with practical use-value.\n\nAs a result, I've also chosen to label key terms as ''Basic'', ''Intermediate'', and ''Advanced''. These labels indicate the general amount of knowledge you'll need in order to apply the idea to your gameplay. Thus, //Attacking// is a ''Basic Mechanic'' since you can apply it immediately without needing to understand anything more than //Winning// and //Health//. My previous example of //Corner Pressure//, was an cursory explanation of an ''Advanced Strategy''.\n\nNext, I can provide you with a more detailed [[explanation|Game Mechanics & Techniques (Definition)]] of Mechanics and Techniques.\n\nI could also [[speak a bit more|More Theory]] about the relationship between each part of the spectrum.\n\nOr, you can also check my [[notes|Notes on Formatting]] about how I'm choosing to highlight terminolgy.</div><div tiddler="Frame Perfect" tags="" modified="201310172226" created="201310172226" modifier="twee">Frame perfect refers to specific cases of timing an action such that you finish the input on the first frame in which you are able to perform it.\n\nIn SFIV, a common example of this is a //one frame link//.</div><div tiddler="Conceptual Framework" tags="" modified="201310161110" created="201310161110" modifier="twee">[[Game Mechanics & Techniques|Game Mechanics & Techniques (Definition)]]\n[[Tactics|Tactics (Definition)]]\nStrategy\nConcepts\nInput\n\n[[More Theory]]</div><div tiddler="Trade" tags="" modified="201310172253" created="201310172253" modifier="twee">Also //&quot;trading&quot;//.\n\nWhen two players hit each other with active hitboxes.</div><div tiddler="Cancelable" tags="" modified="201310172214" created="201310172214" modifier="twee">- All normal moves have one of the four following cancel properties that determine which kind of move may be used to cancel the move: Special Cancelable, Super / EX Focus Cancelable, Whiff Cancelable, Non-cancelable.\n</div><div tiddler="Round Timer" tags="" modified="201310160014" created="201310160014" modifier="twee">The round timer is what keeps track of how much time is left in a round.

It was weird.\n\nI was extremely frustrated after playing a bunch of matches against someone in an endless room. I was trying to practice my spacing and footsies with Juri and after maybe a dozen matches the guy sends me a message saying &quot;stop playing like a scrub.&quot;\n\nHonestly I'm not really sure what that means. I know what the word //means//. But I don't really get it. To the extent that I'm trying my best not to be a scrub, I'm trying to learn what works and what doesn't, and the frustrating part about that is I still haven't seen a vast majority of the things that are possible in the game. This guy was hitting me with this crazy Ibuki mixup I didn't even know was possible. He stunned me at least a half dozen times while I was trying to figure out how to respond to it.\n\nI'm generally fine with gloating and smack-talk in games, especially since I play so many competitive multiplayer games, but I've had mixed experiences with trying to find a place in the FGC. I've had a handful of great experiences where my opponents have recognized that I'm just starting out and trying to learn the game, and have offered help and advice. Most of the time this advice was freely given and offered without me having to ask for it. These people also tend to be either older vets that say something like &quot;I never would have kept playing if someone hadn't offered to teach me,&quot; or friends that are willing to sit around for an hour and train.)\n\nI've also had many experiences where I've played multiple games against an opponent that is obviously much more experienced than I, who either plays a few games and kicks me off or sends me a dismissive message. If I'm online, this becomes horribly depressing, especially after spending an hour getting bodied. It's amazing how easy it is to tell how someone is thinking, even if you're only seeing their character and they never speak to you. As a new player, I've gotten used to getting destroyed by more experienced players and encountering new techniques that I have to learn how to deal with. Psychologically, I find it a lot easier to deal with if it seems like my opponent is trying to teach me something. You can feel this when you're playing. Like if the other player notices that a particular setup they use always catches you, and they keep doing it until you figure it out (or they send you a message saying something like &quot;try using X when I do this&quot; or &quot;you're using Y too much&quot;). You learn that people try not to repeat an action out of fear of becoming predictable, and surprisingly you also learn when someone is trying to troll you rather than teach you.\n\nUnfortunately I've also had this experience offline, as well. It's a bit more subtle, but it's discouraging to play a set of games against someone, lose every single one, and have the person just walk away after.\n\nPatrick Miller wrote an opinion about the FGC ethos of (non)inclusion and a school-of-hard-knocks mentality, and I both agree and disagree. As I've explained, I've had experiences both ways. The discussion is heated and a lot of the responses (at least on Shoryuken) tend to be variations of &quot;You can't single out the FGC as a toxic community. This is an issue in gaming in general,&quot; or &quot;Hey at least we're not the LoL community or CoD kids,&quot; (which I completely understand, but also am beginning to tire of and also beginning to disagree with) or &quot;people being nice to each other doesn't guarantee that we'll have a good community.&quot; Logically, these arguments are all pieces of a kind of truth about the FGC. Yes, there are toxic communities all over and yes there have been successful games with toxic communities: most obvious example being League of Legends. At the same time I'm not sure that saying that the success of a game correlates to the success of its community. Part of the success of LoL is the result of team-based gameplay and the kind of micro-communities that this tends to create. In my experience, most people tend to play with friends (or at least //a// friend, hence duo-queue being part of the matchmaking process--along with arranged teams). A lot of the complaints about the LoL community results from playing &quot;normals,&quot; or what in other games would be called pick-up games (games you play with strangers). Pick-up games have always been strenuous experiences. Doing //anything// with strangers is always an uncertain experience, and any idiosyncracies tend to multiply when anonymity is an option.\n\nIn fact, my experience with the FGC and with LoL and any other videogame I have played mirrors my experience with another game community I also consider myself to be part of: the Go community. I'm a bit adverse to playing the game online because of the same interaction problems that irk me in other games. Online play feel sterile. It feels horrible to play a lengthy game against someone, to struggle for sometimes two or three hours trying to win by a single point, and have the other player walk away afterwards without saying anything more than &quot;gg&quot;. I'm exaggerating slightly, since most of the time if you're playing a match that takes more than an hour to conclude, both players tend to stick around after and review the game. But the Go community's culture of reviewing games is exactly the kind of culture that fosters a sense of community and helps to make new players feel included. It offers a sense of &quot;Look, I may have beaten you by fifty points, but I'm going to spend twenty minutes teaching you something you can use in your next game.&quot; And this happens across all levels of play.\n\nOne potential reason this culture exists in the Go community is that Go is respected as an extremely //difficult// game to play, even by players that are good by most people's standards. There's a certain humility and respect that players observe toward the game itself. If I played a game against a dan-level player and they said something like &quot;stop being a scrub; come back when you learn how to play&quot; I would not only feel hurt, but I would also be offended and surprised that a player such as that can survive in the Go community. I wouldn't play against that person again, even if I think that I could learn something from playing them. I just wouldn't.\n\nOddly, I don't find myself applying that same kind of thinking to the FGC. I've gotten used to the kind of verbal abuse that other players sometimes levy against me. I'm not quite sure why. Perhaps it's an attempt to prove that I can be part of that community, too. A belief that it's some kind of hazing, almost.\n\nThis brings me back to Patrick Miller's article. Yes, there are communities, such as the FGC, which have a reputation for being toxic. Yes, these communities appear to be doing okay, or, at least they're able to produce players who can play at extremely high levels.
